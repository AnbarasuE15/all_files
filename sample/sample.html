                    other.</b><sup> For

            <h1>What is a Programming Language?</h1><br>
            <p class="p1">A programming language is a <strong>computer language </strong>that is used by
                <strong>programmers
                    <sub>(developers) </sub>to communicate with computers.</strong> It is a set of instructions written in any
                specific language <del>( C, C++, Java, Python)</del> to perform a specific task.
                <br>
                <br>
                A programming language is mainly used to <mark>develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile
                    applications.</mark>

            <h1>Types of programming language</h1>
            <h2> <ins>1. Low-level programming language</ins></h2>
            <p>Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level
                programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level
                language can be run very fast.
                <br><br>
                Low-level language is further divided into two parts -
            </p>
            <h3> <i>i. Machine Language</i> </h3>
            <p>Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or object
                code. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form
                (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly
                understand the machine language programs.
                <br><br>
                The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than
                the high-level programming language.
            </p>
            <h3> <i>ii. Object-Oriented Programming language </i></h3>
            <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. In this programming language,
                programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world entities like
                inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable, efficient,
                and easy-to-use.
                <br><br>
                The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain,
                modify, as well as debug.</p>
